Divo – Your Personal Productivity Operating System
Divo is a minimalist, futuristic productivity web app designed to help individuals structure their time, set goals, and execute tasks with focused intensity. Inspired by the aesthetics of iOS/macOS and powered entirely by local storage, Divo runs directly in your browser — no servers, no accounts, no distractions.

Overview
Divo is more than a task manager — it's a compact, standalone productivity ecosystem. Whether you're building a business, studying, or managing your day, Divo provides the tools to stay focused, organized, and in control.

Key Features
Pomodoro-Style Timer – Built-in focus and break intervals

Goal System – Create, track, and complete daily or long-term goals

3D-Inspired UI – A modern, mini operating system feel with smooth interaction

Sound Notifications – Subtle, functional audio cues for productivity

Fully Offline – All data is stored locally using localStorage

Customizable Themes – Change the look and feel (default: black with green accents)

Lightweight Account Simulation – Local-only username and password with visual login indicator

Account System
Divo includes a basic local account experience:

Username Display – Enter once, remembered forever

Password Confirmation – Secures access to your local environment

Account Icon – Confirms active user presence visually

This system is entirely offline. No cloud sync, no remote database, and no external requests. It's designed for personal use, giving you peace of mind and total control over your data.

Technologies Used
HTML5 – Structural foundation of the app

CSS3 – Styling, themes, and responsive layout

JavaScript (Vanilla) – Handles timers, goals, account logic, and interactions
